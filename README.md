- 👋 Hi, I’m @toshkaexe or Tony
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering and topics about machine learing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...


1. There are 2 projects in the direction about RestAPI with Spring Boot and Python and Sqlite https://github.com/toshkaexe/JavaRestAPI and https://github.com/toshkaexe/PythonRestApi_React_SQL_Py3

2. There is a console application in JAVA returns the amount of CO2-equivalent that will be caused when traveling between two cities using a given transportation method.
In the folder staging, you will find co2-calculator.jar  This application uses rest calls to collect coordinates of 2 cities and to create a distance in km between two cities. The is important to save a token for doing rest calls for authorization at the page https://openrouteservice.org/ The API token is stored and read from an environment variable called ORS_TOKEN.
GET request from: https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/api-docs/geocode/search/get
POST request from:https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/api-docs/v2/matrix/{profile}/post

Example: how to run the software 
        $ java -jar co2-calculator.jar --start "Hamburg" --end "Kassel" --transportation-method=bus
        Your trip caused: 8409,0kg of CO2-equivalent
      
        $ java -jar co2-calculator.jar --start Berlin --end Kassel --transportation-method=train
        Your trip caused: 2462,9kg of CO2-equivalent

        $ java -jar co2-calculator.jar --start "Los Angeles" --end "New York" --transportation-method small-diesel-car
        Your trip caused: 640313,9kg of CO2-equivalent
        
        $ java -jar co2-calculator.jar --start "Los Angeles" --end "New York" --transportation-method=large-diesel-car
         Your trip caused: 942433,8kg of CO2-equivalent

3. There is a project in Python about different problems for Data Engineering https://github.com/toshkaexe/DataEngineer_Python 
4. There is a  new project about the game Tic-Tac-Toe in JAVA. Project is not finished
5. Some projects about Machine learning approach and code challenge from the leetcode poage: https://github.com/toshkaexe/MachineLearning_Matlab and https://github.com/toshkaexe/leetcode
