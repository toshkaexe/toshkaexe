### 6. CO2 Emission Calculator

There is a console application in JAVA returns the amount of CO2-equivalent that will be caused when traveling between two cities using a given transportation method. https://github.com/toshkaexe/co2emission In the folder staging, you will find co2-calculator.jar  This application uses rest calls to collect coordinates of 2 cities and to create a distance in km between two cities. The is important to save a token for doing rest calls for authorization at the page https://openrouteservice.org/ The API token is stored and read from an environment variable called ORS_TOKEN. GET request from: https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/api-docs/geocode/search/get POST request from:https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/api-docs/v2/matrix/{profile}/post

#### Example Usage:

```bash
    $ java -jar co2-calculator.jar --start Berlin --end Kassel --transportation-method=train
    Your trip caused: 2462,9kg of CO2-equivalent

    $ java -jar co2-calculator.jar --start "Los Angeles" --end "New York" --transportation-method small-diesel-car
    Your trip caused: 640313,9kg of CO2-equivalent
    
    $ java -jar co2-calculator.jar --start "Los Angeles" --end "New York" --transportation-method=large-diesel-car
     Your trip caused: 942433,8kg of CO2-equivalent
     
    $ java -jar co2-calculator.jar --start "Hamburg" --end "Kassel" --transportation-method=bus
    Your trip caused: 8409,0kg of CO2-equivalent
